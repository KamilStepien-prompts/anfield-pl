Brentford picked up another famous win at home as they defeated reigning champions Liverpool 3-2. The home side took the lead within the first five minutes as Collins glanced a header on for Ouattara to score with a well-taken volley. Liverpool began to put some passes together after that and exerted some pressure, with Wirtz going close. However, Andrews' men would end the half strongly and doubled their advantage as Schade finished after being put clean through by Damsgaard. Kerkez, who had struggled in the first half, gave Liverpool hope with his first goal since joining on the stroke of half-time. Brentford would regain their two goal advantage from the penalty spot following a VAR intervention, as replays showed that Van Dijk had fouled Ouattara on the line after the decision was originally given as a free-kick. Liverpool barely threatened despite being behind but did pull a goal back through a moment of brilliance from Salah. Nevertheless, the Bees held on for a priceless win. In terms of xG, remarkably, both sides generated 2.21. Brentford now travel to Grimsby Town in the League Cup while Liverpool host Crystal Palace in the same competition. That's all from me, thank you and goodbye!

ANOTHER LIFELINE! Brentford will be kicking themselves as they lose the ball playing out from the back. Szoboszlai clips a pass to Salah, who expertly controls the ball on his left before delivering a stunning effort on his weaker foot which fires into the net off the crossbar. Brentford 3-2 Liverpool.

Szoboszlai has been one of Liverpool's better players and gets the assist with some fine vision to find Salah.

GREAT CHANCE! Brentford really should have four! It's brilliant play from Kayode down the right as he makes a fine overlapping run and tees up a cross for the unmarked Thiago but he balloons his header over the crossbar. Nobody in Liverpool colours were close to him.

PENALTY TO BRENTFORD! Dramatic scenes as initially Ouattara is fouled by Van Dijk and a free-kick to the home side are awarded a free-kick. However, following a VAR decision, a penalty is awarded as replays show that contact was made on the line.
Brenntford have scored plenty in the first half, they have also conceded eight during that time,  with only Wolverhampton Wanderers and West Ham, the two bottom clubs in the Premier League, conceding more. The live win probability has their chances of holding on and winning at 49%, with Liverpool's chances at 22.5% and the possibility of a draw at 28.5%. The second half is coming right up.

Brentford lead Liverpool 2-1 after a breathless first half at the Brentford Community Stadium. They took the lead after just five minutes, and it came from a long throw, as Collins flicked a header on for Ouattara to score from close range with a smart volley. Liverpool then began to dominate and did create some chances, with Wirtz going closest but his effort was inches away from finding the corner of the net. Brentford came back into it as the half drew to a close with Damsgaard finding Schade with a brilliant pass and the forward did the rest to put the Bees 2-0 up. However, their perfect half was to be undone as Kerkez finished well at the back post to give the league champions hope. Liverpool lead in terms of xG, with 1.16 in comparison to Brentford's 0.98

GOOOALLL!!!!!!! IT'S A SECOND! It comes on the counter-attack as Liverpool give the ball away cheaply. Damsgaard picks up the loose ball and steadies himself before producing a delicious, defence-splitting pass which sets Schade free on goal. He composes himself and then finds the back of the net with a cool finish. Brentford 2-0 Liverpool.

Damsgaard is such a key player for the Bees and highlighted it there with his wonderful pass which found Schade. Brentford could not have asked for a better first 45 minutes.

BRILLIANT SAVE! Some nice interplay between Kayode and Schade sees Brentford move forward before it breaks down with Thiago. Damsgaard is first to the loose ball and strikes an effort at goal which is tipped over in marvellous fashion by Mamardashvili.

GOOAALLL!!!!!! BRENTFORD LEAD! Liverpool dealt with the first long throw but not the second! It comes in from Kayode and Collins glances it on for Ouattara, who is stronger than Kerkez and expertly hooks the ball into the net from close range. What a start for the home side! Brentford 1-0 Liverpool.

Liverpool will hope to return to winning ways in the Premier League after their European exploits in midweek. They defeated Eintracht Frankfurt 5-1 in the Champions League to end a four match losing run, their worst run of form since November 2014. Last week's match was a bitter one for Arne Slot and his players to take, as they were beaten by rivals Manchester United at Anfield through Harry Maguire's late goal. Nevertheless, they can go within just one point of league leaders Arsenal with a victory in London this evening.

Brentford head into this one on the back of a fine 2-0 victory away to West Ham at the London Stadium. That was their third Premier League win of the season and their first away from home, having lost three matches on their travels prior to their previous match. Keith Andrews' men they currently sit 13th in the table. They have defeated Liverpool once since entering the Premier League four years ago, a 3-1 win at home in January 2023.

Hello and welcome to live coverage of this Premier League clash between Brentford and Liverpool at the Brentford Community Stadium.
