Liverpool lose again. Suffering their fifth straight domestic defeat, the Reds' young side were swept away by Crystal Palace, who reach the EFL Cup's fifth round by winning 3-0 at Anfield. Without most of their established stars in the matchday squad, Slot's makeshift XI started brightly enough but faded fast, and Palace seized control with two clinical Sarr strikes just before half-time: it's now five goals in as many games against Liverpool for the Eagles' winger. Only having untried players on the bench, Slot couldn't spark a comeback, and his team barely created any openings to finish with an xG of 0.45; Palace accrued 1.45 by the final whistle. When inexperienced sub Nallo was sent off for a last-man foul, that compounded Liverpool's woes, and Pino soon added the visitors' third goal as a rain-lashed stadium quickly emptied. While Palace's winless streak is now over, the Reds are reeling from an awful sequence of results since losing at Selhurst Park last month. They must now prepare for upcoming games against in-form Aston Villa and mighty Real Madrid. After watching the fifth-round draw, Crystal Palace will host local rivals Brentford on Saturday. That's all from Anfield, so thank you for joining us and goodbye!

CLOSE! Finally, as we enter the first of at least three added minutes, Liverpool carve out a late chance. Kerkez whips over an inviting cross from the left wing, but young sub Gordon heads narrowly over the crossbar!

LIVERPOOL DOWN TO 10 MEN! Having been caught out by Mateta's delightful throughball, young substitute Nallo can't react in time to cut off Devenny's run. Instead, he resorts to hauling the Crystal Palace sub down, leaving the referee with no choice. He has to walk, and the Reds are now one man down with a two-goal deficit!

Usually in such a situation, managers quickly turn to ther bench in search of fresh inspiration. However, Slot has left Salah, Isak and co out of the matchday squad entirely, so his options are limited to untested rookies. Liverpool can still push the tie into penalties by scoring at least twice - there is no extra-time at this stage of the EFL Cup - but it's hard to see where those goals will come from. Ngumoha has been bright, but Chiesa - who missed two decent chances before the break - is looking a little isolated. These are worrying times for the Anfield faithful.

There's more misery for ailing Liverpool, as the Reds trail Crystal Palace 2-0 in the driving rain at Anfield. With a relatively inexperienced starting XI - and an unusual formation - the hosts started more sharply, but they are now in serious danger of exiting the EFL Cup. Palace took their time to find confidence and rhythm, but they had been probing for some time before Sarr struck twice. Taking his tally to five goals in as many games versus Liverpool, the Senegalese star twice found the bottom-right corner with shots from just inside the box, capitalising on some loose defending. The Eagles compiled an xG of 0.9 to the Reds' meagre 0.38, so they can claim to deserve their healthy half-time advantage. As things stand, Slot's side are heading for a fifth straight domestic defeat; Glasner's men are heading for the fifth round.

GOAL!!! SARR DOUBLES UP! Suddenly, Crystal Palace lead 2-0 at Anfield! This time, Kamada and Sarr link up in midfield, before Pino picks out the latter with a precise pass. Sarr then scores his fifth goal in as many games against Liverpool by firing into the right side of the net: Woodman had no chance!

GOAL!!! PALACE LEAD AT ANFIELD! Sarr strikes again! When Gomez fails to clear Kamada's throughball, which takes a slight touch off Munoz in the box, Crystal Palace pounce! The ball runs nicely for Sarr, who scores his latest goal against Liverpool by firing past Woodman into the bottom-right corner: it's 1-0 to the Eagles!

CHANCE! Picked out by Pino, who crosses back from the left flank, Hughes tries his luck with a first-time volley from just inside Liverpool's box. It's almost caught too cleanly, flying straight into the chest of Woodman in the centre of the goal.

SAVE! Benitez keeps Chiesa out! The Liverpool forward drives down the left byline and seems set to deliver a low cross, but instead he lashes a shot towards the near post. Palace's back-up 'keeper is alert to the danger, though, and he makes a smart stop at close range!

CHANCE! Latching on to a long clearance upfield, Chiesa bustles his way past Canvot and Lacroix before taking the ball on his thigh and lining up a shot. His attempt is slightly rushed, though, and zips high over the crossbar! He should've found the target.

Attempting to impose on himself on the game, Liverpool's lone striker Chiesa barges recklessly into the back of Hughes, who ends up taking a heavy blow. So, a few seconds after getting started, the action is paused while the Palace midfielder recives treatment.
Both teams are out under the Anfield floodlights, so kick-off in this EFL Cup clash is now just moments away!

While their hosts are ailing, Crystal Palace have also endured a dire run since seeing their club-record 19-game unbeaten streak - which included an EFL Cup win over Millwall - finally ended. In fact, the Eagles have failed to win a Premier League game since beating Liverpool at Selhurst Park last month. Losing to London rivals Arsenal left Palace winless in four, but they will now continue their quest for more silverware: the FA Cup and Community Shield holders have never lifted the EFL Cup.

Having lost five of their last six matches, Liverpool are finding life far tougher than at this time last year. Though they seemed to have turned a corner with a 5-1 Champions League thumping of Eintracht Frankfurt, the defending Premier League champions are still in relegation form. Last time out, Brentford condemned Arne Slot’s side to a fourth straight league loss, already matching the same number of top-flight defeats they suffered throughout last season. Seven points adrift of leaders Arsenal, the Reds now return to a competition they’ve won a record 10 times before, most recently in 2022 - they were EFL Cup runners-up last term.
