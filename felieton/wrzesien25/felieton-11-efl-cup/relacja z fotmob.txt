An intriguing affair at Anfield comes to a close, with Liverpool - rather than the Saints - marching on to the fourth round of the EFL Cup. However, the hosts would have expected a far more comfortable evening. Southampton performed exceptionally well in the opening 45 minutes, as Arne Slot’s men struggled to pull together any fluid passages of play. Armstrong spurned a fantastic opportunity just before the break, a miss which was quickly punished by Aleksander Isak. The Swede’s first goal for the club gave Liverpool a rather fortunate lead, but this was wiped out when Shea Charles pounced on a string of defensive errors to convert from close range. The Saints fans positioned in the Anfield Road End must have been dreaming of a famous victory, but Ekitike had other ideas. The Frenchman tapped home the winner with just five minutes left on the clock as Chiesa claimed his second assist of the evening, but subsequently received a second yellow card for removing his shirt in celebration. The stats highlight how far Southampton pushed their ‘superior’ adversaries – the visitors had more shots, delivered a higher xG rating, and made a greater number of entries into the final third. Ultimately, however, Liverpool just had too much quality for the Championship outfit. Thanks for joining our live commentary of this EFL Cup third round clash – we’ll see you next time!!

Can Southampton go again? The Saints are throwing everything at it, but are becoming increasingly frustrated by their inability to create any further chances. Liverpool are defending well, so a late equaliser is beginning to look unlikely....

For all Southampton's positive work, Will Still knows his team must start to show a little more intent in forward areas. They have managed a shot on target in this second half, which will be a slight source of disappointment for the Saints boss. There's still approximately 20 minutes remaining however, so plenty of time for the visitors to find an equaliser.

Liverpool are starting to really push for a second now, but are struggling to put Alex McCarthy under any pressure in the Southampton goal. Andy Robertson swings in a dangerous-looking corner, but Hugo Ekitike can't get a flick-on at the near post and the ball drifts harmlessly out. A few groans reverberate around Anfield as frustration begins to grow.

DISALLOWED GOAL!!! A beautifully slick move from Liverpool ends at Chiesa's feet, before the Italian rifles a thunderous drive past McCarthy from an acute angle. However, the linesman has his flag up!! There's no VAR this evening, but it wouldn't have intervened anyway as Chiesa strayed a good couple of yards offside.

FULL-TIME: LIVERPOOL 2-1 SOUTHAMPTON

The teams re-emerge for the second half. Liverpool will be hoping to make a quick start after falling below thier usual standards in the opening 45 minutes, while Southampton must try to replicate their first-half performance.

Southampton will be devastated to have lost a goal before the interval, having more than matched their esteemed opponents for large spells of the first half. Will Still will be delighted his team have managed to keep possession for sustained periods, while also carrying a threat in the final third. Armstrong looked particularly dangerous throughout the early stages of the tie, while Irish full-back Ryan Manning whipped several teasing crosses into the box. Contrastingly, Arne Slot cut a frustrated figure on the Anfield touchline until Isak fired the Reds in front, but will still be expecting major improvements from his side in the second half. The Swedish marksman had missed a guilt-edge chance in the opening seconds of the contest, but later made up for this by clipping the ball over the onrushing Alex McCarthy to claim his first goal in Liverpool colours. Although the Opta Win predictor has given the Reds a 95% chance of going on to win this third round clash, you’d be foolish to discount the Saints at this stage. If the visitors can do more of the same in the next 45 minutes, they’ll definitely carve out some further opportunities. All to play for!

Southampton should be commended for the start they've made.

The hosts get the game underway. Liverpool will shoot towards the Anfield Road End in the first half, while Southampton attack the Kop.

The players are emerging from the tunnel, as both sets of fans rise to applaud their teams at a packed Anfield. There will be a moment's reflection for Matt Beard before kick-off, after the former Liverpool Women manager sadly passed away over the weekend.

Will Still initially started the season with a back three, but flipped to a 4-2-3-1 formation in recent weeks. The former Lens boss has reverted to a central defensive trio this evening, as he aims to neutralize the hosts’ attacking threat – easier said than done. Flynn Downes missed Saturday’s disappointment defeat to Hull City through illness, but returns to Southampton’s starting line-up this evening.

Arne Slot confirmed earlier in the week that Dominik Szoboszlai, Mohamed Salah, Ryan Gravenberch, Ibrahima Konaté, and Virgil van Dijk would all be rested for this tie, given that each player has started all six of Liverpool’s fixtures this term. There’s opportunities for talented teenager Trey Nyoni and forgotten man Federico Chiesa, while Wataru Endo will be attempting to stake a claim for a more regular starting berth. Giorgi Mamardashvili replaces Alisson Becker between the sticks, as the Georgian international makes his long-awaited debut for the Reds. Isak starts up front.

SUBS: Taylor Harwood-Bellis, Ross Stewart, Tom Fellows, Shea Charles, George Long, Ryan Fraser, Kuryu Matsuki, Damion Downs, Jay Robinson

SOUTHAMPTON (5-4-1): Alex McCarthy, Joshua Quarshie, Nathan Wood, Ronnie Edwards, Ryan Manning, Elias Jelert, Léo Scienza, Caspar Jander, Flynn Downes, Cameron Archer, Adam Armstrong

No club has won the League Cup more times than Liverpool, who are targeting a record-extending eleventh triumph this term. The Reds last won the competition during the 2023/24 campaign, when Virgil van Dijk’s extra-time header sunk Chelsea in the Wembley showpiece. Southampton have twice reached the League Cup final, but were forced to settle for runners-up medals on both occasions after Nottingham Forest (1979) and Manchester United (2017) claimed first prize.

After winning in just one of their six Championship outings following relegation from the Premier League, Southampton have endured an underwhelming start to life in the second-tier. This solitary victory came on the opening weekend, which saw the Saints beat Phil Parkinson’s ambitious Wrexham outfit at St. Marys. Will Still’s men are set to play their third away fixture in this season’s EFL Cup, having kept clean sheets at Northampton’s Sixfields Stadium and Norwich’s Carrow Road in the competition’s first and second rounds respectively.

Liverpool have made a superb start to the new campaign, winning each of their opening five Premier League fixtures and edging Atletico Madrid in last week’s pulsating Champions League clash at Anfield. The Reds have already scored ten goals on home soil this term, with two of these coming against Merseyside rivals Everton at the weekend. Due to their continental commitments, this is Liverpool’s first outing in this season’s EFL Cup.
