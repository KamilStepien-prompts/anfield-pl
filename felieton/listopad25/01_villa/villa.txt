The full-time whistle sounds at Anfield, as Liverpool produce arguably their most composed performance of the season to see out a 2-0 win over Aston Villa! After four straight league losses ahead of this match, Salah's fortunate first-half opener laid the platform for Liverpool and they capitalised in the second period. The Reds generated 1.09 xG in total, and doubled their advantage with their first clear-cut chance of the half when Gravenberch's shot from the edge of the box was helped beyond Martinez via a deflection off Torres. Further openings followed for Salah, Gakpo and Bradley, but Liverpool didn't need to add further to the scoreline and kept the visitors at arm's length for the final 35 minutes. Substitutes Barkley, Malen and Sancho all struck high and wide for Aston Villa, who couldn't find a way back into the contest and see their four-game winning streak end with a whimper. They remain eleventh in the Premier League table, while a formerly out-of-sorts Liverpool climb back up to a much more familiar third, ready to use this victory as a springboard for their revival in the title race.

Mac Allister opened up all the space Gravenberch needed there, and the eventual strike from the Dutchman was also given a helping hand to beat Martinez.

GOOOOOOOOOOOAAAAAALLL!!!! Liverpool double their advantage!! Gakpo and Mac Allister combine as the latter sends Gravenberch running into open space. The returning midfielder drives his way to the edge of the box, before drilling a left-footed strike which takes a nick off Torres to wrong-foot Martnez and find the back of the net!! 2-0 to the Reds at Anfield, and a first Premier League win in five now looks very real for Arne Slot's side!

CHANCE!!! Gakpo drifts in-field from the left and finds Salah with a clipped pass towards the far post. He nods the ball down for Bradley to lash a half-volley goalwards and force a good save from Martinez, but the offside flag goes up to penalise Salah in the aftermath!
Gakpo has been an ever-present threat on the left for Liverpool so far, with three shots on goal already and two big chances created. The Liverpool wideman is yet to misplace any of his six final-third passes and has also won five duels from five, including two dribbles and aerial duels apiece, and turning possession over in Aston Villa's own third. Key.

A frantic first half comes to an end at Anfield, as Liverpool head into the break with a narrow 1-0 lead over Aston Villa! Opportunity flowed at both ends almost straight from kick-off, as Villa struck the woodwork through Rogers and saw Cash, Rogers and Guessand all trouble Mamardashvili despite the visitors generating just 0.15 xG. Liverpool managed 0.96 xG at the other end with a plethora of chances for Gravenberch, Szoboszlai, Gakpo and Konate, before Ekitike thought he'd put the hosts 1-0 up with a near-post header from Szoboszlai's cross. VAR's automated offside technology may have denied the Frenchman, but Liverpool would take the lead just moments later when Martinez's loose pass out from the back was latched onto by Salah. His first-time finish into an empty net gives the Reds the advantage at half-time, leaving Aston Villa with a mountain to climb as Liverpool look to end their four-game losing streak.

GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOAAAAALLLLL!!!!! Lift-off for Liverpool right on half-time!!! Torres finds himself in a cul-de-sac of red shirts and passes back to Martinez, whose wide ball back to the Spaniard is woefully misplaced. The ball is hit straight to Salah, and the Liverpool legend seizes straight onto it, tapping into an empty net and giving the hosts the 1-0 lead they were denied just moments ago!

BALL IN THE NET!!! Liverpool are denied by the automated offside system!!! After Salah and Gravenberch combine to play Mac Allister in behind, the Argentine's snap-shot is blocked away from danger, but the Reds remain on the attack through Szoboszlai. He crosses and Ekitike rises at the near post to send a glancing header beyond Martinez and into the net, but crucial replays in the midst of Liverpool's celebrations show that the striker was a good yard offside!

Despite their drastic fall-off in form in recent weeks, it’s still Liverpool who are being tipped for victory in our live tracker ahead of kick-off at Anfield. The Reds have a 55.3% probability of winning this game as the two sides head out onto the pitch, but in-form Villa will be keen to continue their recent displays and spin their pre-match win prediction of 21.7% on its head!

Aston Villa’s opening to the campaign has come in almost direct contrast to that of Liverpool, with their winless start extending to five matches before a run of four straight victories coming into this one. Unai Emery’s team have turned Fulham, Burnley, Tottenham and Manchester City over in recent weeks, and will be confident they can add Liverpool to that list.

Liverpool’s relentless start to their Premier League title defence is firmly in the rear-view mirror now, with the Reds following up five straight wins with four defeats in a row ahead of this match. Arne Slot’s side have also suffered defeats in the Champions League and been dumped out of the EFL Cup by Crystal Palace, making this game a must-win in order to address their slide.

Hello, and welcome to live coverage of this Premier League fixture, as the beleaguered defending champions Liverpool host Aston Villa at Anfield.
